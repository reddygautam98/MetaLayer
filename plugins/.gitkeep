# This file ensures the plugins/ directory is tracked by Git
# The plugins/ directory is required by the Dockerfile COPY command
# even when no custom Airflow plugins are present.

# To add custom Airflow plugins:
# 1. Place your plugin files in this directory
# 2. They will be automatically copied to ${AIRFLOW_HOME}/plugins/ during Docker build
# 3. Airflow will load them automatically on startup

# Example structure:
# plugins/
# ├── .gitkeep (this file)
# ├── my_custom_operator.py
# ├── my_custom_hook.py
# └── my_custom_plugin/
#     ├── __init__.py
#     └── operators.py
